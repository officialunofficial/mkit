# Invariants

Properties that must always hold across the mkit monorepo, outside any
single crate or spec. Each entry states the invariant, why it matters, and
what breaks when it is violated. A regression test enforces each one; find
it by the file path listed under "Enforced by".

## Git audit establishes correspondence without a signing key

**Always:** imported graph edges and translated unsigned fields are derived
from retained Git bytes and checked under the pinned public key. A head's
provenance claim must match its exact subject, ref, source and versions.

**Because:** valid signatures on unrelated twins do not authenticate a mutable
Git-to-mkit mapping cache.

**If violated:** swapped mappings or unrelated attestations can pass an audit.

**Enforced by:** `rust/crates/mkit-cli/tests/git_import_integration.rs` mapping
swap, unrelated attestation and private-key removal regressions; the full
45-test integration suite passes. Golden translated bytes remain unchanged.

## File equality survives valid representation changes

**Always:** different file object IDs compare by verified byte streams; modes
remain separate. Restaging identical content keeps the staged ID. Chunk failures
remain errors, including after the first differing byte.

**Because:** an inline Blob, fixed-size manifest and CDC manifest may describe
the same bytes with different immutable object identities.

**If violated:** clean worktrees appear modified, restaging changes identity,
and merge or overwrite decisions depend on chunk boundaries.

**Enforced by:** core `worktree::blob::equality_tests`,
`ops::diff::tests::equal_content_different_chunk_layout_is_clean`, and
`rust/crates/mkit-cli/tests/content_representation_integration.rs`. Comparison
holds at most one chunk per side plus manifests; rename fingerprints are
memoized for one diff and confirmed by byte comparison.

## Requested transport identities are checked before effects

**Always:** fetched packs and metadata match their requested keys; shard
manifests name the requested pack before reconstruction. Sparse selections are
derived from canonical Tree witnesses verified against independently known IDs.

**Because:** internally valid content can still be a substituted response.

**If violated:** transports can publish unrequested objects or incomplete paths.

**Enforced by:** packmap substitution tests, HTTP/S3 shard suites, core sparse
v2 mutation/completeness tests and `rust/tests/golden/sparse/response_v2.bin`.

## Every ref mutation participates in its lock protocol

**Always:** local Any, Missing, Match and deletion take the same full-ref guard.
The order is registry, worktrees, history, then ref mutation locks; peers within
a class use canonical order. File transport serializes all condition variants
within its separate transport lock domain.

**Because:** an unconditional writer can invalidate a conditional writer's
observation just as another CAS writer can.

**If violated:** reported successful updates lose writes or expose invalid
history publication states.

**Enforced by:** core refs and file-transport contention regressions, CLI
history lifecycle and publication retry tests.

## History evidence binds ancestry, generation and context

**Always:** a trusted proof describes the canonical first-parent chain for the
expected repository, ref, tip and generation. Pending durable intents pin both
previous and target tips as GC roots even without the history feature enabled.

**Because:** a mutation journal is not an ancestry proof, and publication spans
multiple durable files.

**If violated:** rewinds, resets, ABA or interrupted writes can issue misleading
proofs or let GC remove objects needed to recover.

**Enforced by:** `history/ancestry.rs` chain/context/generation and six-boundary
failure tests, and core GC intent-root tests. Current descriptors establish
local trust only; snapshots/reconstruction cost O(chain length), capped at one
million leaves. Only canonical ancestry snapshots are supported.

## Staging selections are durable; stat caches are disposable

**Always:** current index data preserves path, mode, staged object and deletion
intent. Only checksummed v3 is accepted. Unknown, empty or corrupt index data
stops operations that rely on staging, including GC; it is never converted or
rebuilt from working files.

**Because:** HEAD and the working file cannot reconstruct a partial selection.

**If violated:** recovery silently replaces staged A with working B or garbage
collect the only copy of staged content.

**Enforced by:** current index checksum/round-trip and unsupported-version
rejection tests, current golden fixtures, and GC no-sweep-on-corruption coverage.

## Authenticated write effects and replay state commit together

**Always:** auth v2 verifies configured audience, decoded repository, procedure,
content commitment, times and nonce before effects. Retries keep their operation
identity. SQLite adapters commit mutable effects, quota and replay response in
one transaction; immutable publication records a recoverable reservation first.

**Because:** signature validity alone cannot prevent cross-service replay or
repeating an effect after a crash.

**If violated:** a captured request can move a ref back, toggle a reaction twice,
restore an old name or charge duplicate upload quota.

**Enforced by:** shared core canonical/context tests; Connect retry tests;
actual local Workers regressions in `apps/{repo-worker,vcs-worker,keys-worker}/tests/`;
web/spammer envelope tests. Keys failure injection after name and result writes
rolls back both; saved results survive a full Worker restart. Production builds
omit `test-faults`. Only auth v2 is accepted. Names use SQLite exclusively.

## External signer capabilities precede signing material

**Always:** the external signer returns compatible protocol, algorithm,
message-size and interaction capabilities before receiving SignRequest bytes.
All subprocess I/O retains frame and wall-clock bounds.

**Because:** advertising capabilities after signing cannot enforce them.

**If violated:** an incompatible signer can perform a request before rejection.

**Enforced by:** external signer no-sign-on-incompatible-handshake regressions,
PIN/timeout subprocess tests and the bundled file signer's end-to-end test.

## Dependabot ecosystem matches the lockfile format

**Always:** every directory with its own lockfile has a `.github/dependabot.yml`
update entry whose `package-ecosystem` matches that lockfile's format
(`cargo` for `Cargo.lock`, `bun` for `bun.lock`, `npm` for `package-lock.json`).
Every composite GitHub Action under `.github/actions/*/action.yml` has its
own `github-actions` entry, because a `directory: "/"` entry only scans
`.github/workflows/`.

**Because:** Dependabot edits only the manifest for the ecosystem it thinks
it is running. An `npm` entry pointed at a `bun`-only directory edits
`package.json` but never touches `bun.lock`. CI installs with
`bun install --frozen-lockfile`, which rejects a manifest whose lockfile did
not change with it.

**If violated:** every PR Dependabot opens for that directory fails CI on
the frozen-lockfile install step and gets closed unmerged, silently, on a
recurring weekly schedule. See `apps/web`'s Dependabot PRs #921, #922, #923,
#931, and #934 — all closed unmerged for exactly this reason before this
invariant was enforced.

**Enforced by:** `scripts/check-dependabot-coverage.sh`, run by the
"Meta: actionlint" workflow on any change to `.github/dependabot.yml`,
`.github/workflows/**`, or `.github/actions/**`.

## Single crypto-stack version across workspaces

**Always:** `ed25519-dalek` and `sha2` are pinned to the same
Cargo-semver-compatible version (for a `0.y.z` crate, `y` is the breaking
component; for `x.y.z` with `x >= 1`, `x` is) in every Cargo workspace that
declares them: `rust/`, `contrib/signers/`, and the `apps/*-worker`
standalone packages.

**Because:** several crates independently re-verify signatures/digests the
same byte-for-byte way another crate already does — `mkit-wasm`'s raw
Ed25519 exports vs. `mkit-core::sign`, and every `apps/*-worker`'s
write-envelope strict-verify vs. `mkit-core`'s own `verify_strict` call —
and the golden-vector and cross-impl-parity tests (e.g.
`mkit-wasm::ed25519::cross_impl_parity_with_dalek`,
`mkit-keystore`'s `*_matches_golden_vectors`) assert that stays true. A
drifted major/breaking version of the same crypto crate across workspaces
can silently diverge in wire-visible behavior (ed25519-dalek 2->3 dropped
the `std` feature and moved error types to `core::error::Error`; a future
bump could change verification semantics) with nothing forcing every
workspace to move together.

**If violated:** nothing fails to compile — each workspace has its own
lockfile, so two incompatible versions of the same crypto crate can coexist
silently. A behavior difference between them (a stricter/laxer signature
check, a different digest padding) would only surface as a hard-to-trace
cross-service inconsistency, not a build error.

**Enforced by:** `scripts/check-crypto-stack-version.sh`, run by the
"Meta: crypto-stack version" workflow on any change to a `Cargo.toml` under
`rust/`, `contrib/signers/`, or `apps/`.

## A live `mkit serve` is detectable by local worktree commands

**Always:** every live `mkit serve` process holds a **shared** kernel
lock (`mkit_core::repo_lock::acquire_shared`) on `<common_dir>/serve.lock`
for its entire lifetime, across all three of its modes (stdin SSH-frame,
`--listen-enc`, `--http`). Every command that acquires `worktree.lock`
or `worktrees.lock` (`mkit-cli`'s `acquire_worktree_lock` /
`acquire_worktrees_registry_lock`) immediately probes that same
`serve.lock` non-blocking-exclusive (`mkit_core::repo_lock::probe_exclusive`)
and, if it finds the lock busy, prints a warning to stderr naming the
served root before proceeding.

**Because:** `mkit-transport-file`'s only lock (`<root>/.mkit/refs/.lock`)
serializes file-transport instances against *each other*, not against
local worktree mutation or `gc` (SPEC-CONCURRENCY §3.1). Running `mkit
gc` or a worktree-mutating command directly against a root a live `mkit
serve` is also operating on is unsupported and uncoordinated; without
this invariant, nothing distinguishes that misuse from an ordinary,
safe invocation, and the failure (a `gc` sweep racing a concurrent
push's object write, or a lost ref update) surfaces only as
after-the-fact corruption with no diagnostic pointing at the cause.

**If violated:** a `gc` can silently sweep objects a concurrent `mkit
serve` client just uploaded, or a local commit/checkout can silently
lose a race against a client push — both without any warning ever
appearing, leaving an operator no reason to suspect the concurrent-serve
misconfiguration until data is already gone. This is detection only,
not coordination: a direct `mkit push mkit+file:///path` (bypassing
`mkit serve`) and a `serve` that starts *during* an already-in-flight
local critical section both remain undetected — see SPEC-CONCURRENCY
§3.1 for the full statement of what this warning does and does not
cover.

**Enforced by:** `mkit-cli/tests/serve_guard.rs`.

## Single commonware release train across every manifest and lockfile

**Always:** every `commonware-<name>` dependency — in `rust/Cargo.toml`,
every `rust/crates/*/Cargo.toml`, `rust/fuzz/Cargo.toml`,
`contrib/signers/Cargo.toml`, and the `apps/*-worker` manifests — pins the
exact same version string (e.g. `=2026.9.0`, not merely a compatible
range), AND every `Cargo.lock` in those same trees that contains a
`commonware-*` package resolves to that same version.

**Because:** the commonware crates (`-storage`, `-cryptography`,
`-runtime`, `-coding`, `-codec`, `-parallel`, `-utils`, `-stream`,
`-invariants`) ship as one coordinated release; mkit's on-disk formats
(the ancestry MMR, the BLS threshold derivation) and wire
compatibility depend on the exact same version being linked everywhere a
crate touches them. A manifest bump without a matching `cargo update` in
every workspace leaves the *text* aligned while the *lockfile* — what
actually gets compiled — stays on the old train, silently defeating the
single-version intent this file's `check_crate` (ed25519-dalek/sha2)
already establishes.

**If violated:** nothing fails to compile — each workspace has its own
lockfile, so `rust/` can be on `2026.9.0` while `contrib/signers/` is still
locked to `2026.7.1`, undetected until an on-disk format or golden-vector
test run against the stale workspace disagrees with one run against the
bumped one.

**Enforced by:** `scripts/check-crypto-stack-version.sh`'s
`check_commonware_family`, run by the "Meta: crypto-stack version"
workflow (trigger paths include `**/Cargo.lock` under `rust/`,
`contrib/signers/`, and `apps/*`, not just `Cargo.toml`).

## commonware `Strategy` cannot be spied on from outside commonware-parallel

**Always:** `crates/mkit-core/src/pack_shard.rs`'s test suite does not
attempt to assert that a caller-supplied `commonware_parallel::Strategy`
was *invoked* by the encode/decode core (only that a real, non-default
strategy compiles against the generic entry points and round-trips
correctly — see `round_trip_with_explicit_parallel_strategy`).

**Because:** commonware-parallel 2026.9.0 made `Strategy` impossible to
implement from outside the `commonware-parallel` crate itself:
`Strategy::manual` must return a `Manual<Self>`, and `Manual`'s fields are
private with no public constructor left (`Manual::new` was removed). The
`CountingStrategy` spy this test module used to define — an `impl
Strategy` that counted `fold_init` calls to prove the supplied strategy
was genuinely exercised, not merely accepted and discarded — can no
longer be written.

**If violated:** re-adding an external `impl Strategy` (e.g. to restore
the invocation-count assertion) will not compile against the pinned
commonware-parallel train; if it is somehow worked around, treat the
resulting test as unable to prove what its name claims.

**Enforced by:** `crates/mkit-core/src/pack_shard.rs`'s
`round_trip_with_explicit_parallel_strategy` (compiles + round-trips a
real `Rayon` strategy) as the remaining guard; the comment block above it
records why the invocation-count assertion cannot be rebuilt.

## Windows is not a build, test, or release target

**Always:** no workflow, action, `justfile` recipe, crate manifest, or
installer targets Windows — no `windows-latest` / `pc-windows-msvc` CI
runner, no `backend-windows-credential` / `windows-credential` keystore
feature, no `install.ps1` or Scoop packaging, and no
`[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]` stanza in any `Cargo.toml`.
`BackendKind` has no Windows Credential Manager variant.

**Because:** commonware-runtime 2026.9.0's storage-sync path calls
`libc::sync()` on every non-Linux target (`rust/crates/mkit-transport-enc`
depends on `commonware-runtime` unconditionally, and `mkit-core`'s
dev-dependencies pull it in
too) — `libc::sync()` does not exist on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, so the
workspace and its test suite no longer build there. Maintaining a Windows
CI/release leg that cannot actually build or test the workspace would ship
an untested binary, so Windows was dropped as a supported target (MKIT-6)
rather than worked around. Windows users run mkit under WSL, which uses
the Linux binary.

**If violated:** a reintroduced Windows CI leg goes red on every PR (the
workspace fails to build there); a reintroduced Windows release leg ships
a binary no test ever exercised; a reintroduced
`backend-windows-credential` feature reopens a semver-breaking
`BackendKind` variant on a published crate (`mkit-keystore`) without the
required major bump.

**Enforced by:** `scripts/check-no-windows-target.sh`, run by the
"Meta: actionlint" workflow on any change to the CI workflows, `justfile`,
crate manifests, `install.sh`, or the web app's installer-staging scripts.
`mkit-keystore`'s `windows_credential_backend_name_is_not_recognized` test
(`crates/mkit-keystore/src/lib.rs`) pins that `"windows-credential"` is an
unrecognized `BackendKind`/`KeyRef` backend string, not a fail-closed one.
